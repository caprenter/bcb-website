===========

This is the code to extend the Responsive Theme to create a child theme
for the BCB site.

The Responsive Theme was created under version 3 of the GPL by 
CyberChimps:
http://cyberchimps.com/responsive-theme/

A copy of the licence is under licence.txt

The child theme has been created in the first instance by caprenter, 
and is a derivative work that relies on the Responsive Theme code linked
to above.

This code will not work unless deployed as a child theme of the 
Responsive Theme. The Responsive Theme is NOT included in this 
repository. You should get your own version of the theme first.
As the parent theme alters and updates, we plan to keep this code in
with the current release.

Everything here is also provided under GPLv3 unless stated otherwise. 
In practice the exceptions are the ZendGdata libraries and some 
javscript libraries as described in the Responsive-Theme-readme.txt

Parsing of Google Calendars relies on the ZendGata code libraries which 
is released under the Zend Framework license. You can find a copy of 
this license in the ZendGdata directory underLICENSE.txt.
